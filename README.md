Hello, Iâ€™m Yuliana. 

I am an aspiring Data Analyst, currently working as a Foreign Exchange Controls Economist working at a bank, with a BSc and an MSc degrees in Banking and Finance. 

I started learning SQL and Python as a hobby, in order to diversify my skillset, and to improve my data analysis capabilities.
